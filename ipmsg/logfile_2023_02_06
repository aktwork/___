I want to see your demo link.
Would you share your demo link of your project?

3D product configurators is a major new trend in online marketing and e-commerce. They were made possible thanks to the rapid development of WebGL, a technology for displaying 3D graphics right in the customers’ web browsers. With threejs we can build interactive 3D configurator. 
I'd like to see the process of making a 3D shirt configurator together, which looks like following domain.
https://www.deoveritas.com/shirt-design

Summary

Create 3D content (models + materials).
Make your 3D app interactive by using the threejs editor.

Let’s review the production process step-by-step.

Creating 3D content

This step is the most complicated. 
As I can't make the model, so I worked with modeler who has an experience in blender.

Then create the models. For the best results, the 3D objects should be middle or low-poly, basically we don't use more than 100k polygons per model.

The next stage is creating materials and textures.
Shirt Fabric
For the shirt fabric, we had to use less metalness and more roughness with a texture with noise and normal map textures.
So it makes the rendered material more realistic.


Adding interactivity
With threejs, we can create a 3D configurator. We just use the “when clicked fabric tab" to change the texture of the shirt, “when clicked design tab” to change the shirt shape. In this configurator, we have various different shirt models which come with collars, cuffs and placket variants.

If the arm part is different color and texture, it can be replaced the image and color of the part of   model's mesh

This is how the logic looks like in the editor:

See, there is nothing complicated here. On the left side, you can choose the individual fabric and design, we can get the changed result.
In total, this app offers as much as various variations!

Sure, I'm looking for someon with Supabase experience, and you mentioned that. Could you tell me a bit about your experience with Next.js and Supabase?
4:29 PM
User Avatar
Yes, I used next.js and supabase many time .
4:32 PM
I started development in 2017 and first I learned laravel but I am interested in React and next,js and started coding since 2019 .
4:33 PM
This is my first project using supabase and Next.js.
4:34 PM

Sounds awesome! I see you have used Typescript for that project. How woudl you estimate your typescript experience?
4:39 PM
User Avatar
I started Js developement with typescript from the first time.
4:45 PM

Kudos to you, that's impressive!
4:45 PM

Thank you.
4:46 PM

Would you be able to solve the issues described in the job ad?
4:46 PM
User Avatar
Yes Of course.
4:46 PM
User Avatar
Sounds great. From a scale from 1 to 10, how difficult would this be for you?
4:47 PM
User Avatar
about 3-5
4:48 PM
I think this is the solution for the first issue.https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage#allow-public-access-to-a-bucket
4:49 PM
Anyway , Let me check your code.
4:50 PM
User Avatar
Sounds interessting. When would you be available to jump in on the project?
4:50 PM
User Avatar
I can start right now.
4:50 PM
User Avatar
Given the nature of the task, I'm looking to get this done by today.
4:50 PM
Sounds awesome. Let me setup the Github repo. Would you also be willing to do a quick voice call to explain the project?
4:51 PM
User Avatar
I will send github username to invitation .
But Unfortunately I can't have a call now ,My mic was broken .
4:53 PM
User Avatar
Oh, I see. We can stick to the chat in that case. I'm just trying to make sure that we are on the same level of understanding.
4:55 PM

Thank you for understanding.

4:57 PM
User Avatar
This project is on hourly base. Does that work for you?
4:58 PM
User Avatar
Yes.
5:00 PM
User Avatar
So, I was thinking about the following approach.

- I'll give you access to the github repo
- You setup the project on your local machine (including supabase backend using SQL script)
- You review the errors
- You let me know how long it will take and why

What do you think?
5:02 PM
User Avatar
Okay good.
5:03 PM
May I include env install time to worktime?
5:03 PM
User Avatar
Yes
5:04 PM
User Avatar
Thank you.
5:04 PM
User Avatar
I will provide access to the complete project, including sql for supabase and the env file
5:04 PM
User Avatar
Okay
5:05 PM
User Avatar
For legal reasons, I need you to confirm the following:

By providing you access to the github repo, where the complete project is hosted, I grant you permission to set the project up for the fullfillment of the tasks. I do not transfer any Intellectual Property to you by doing so. If you have read and agreed with the above, please reply with "Yes, I understand"
5:07 PM
User Avatar
Yes , I understand.
5:08 PM
User Avatar
Great. Give me 15 min to set it all up.
5:10 PM
User Avatar
Okay
5:10 PM
User Avatar
Please give me 5 more minutes slightly smiling face emoji
5:30 PM
User Avatar
Okay
5:30 PM
User Avatar
Added you to the repo. Included all the instructions you need.

Please set the project up, and let me know what you think in terms of time and if it's doable for you.
5:34 PM
In case of anye questions, please let me know so I can help you.
5:35 PM
And for Auth, you can stick to Github only. In case you need help to set that up, I can send you instructions
5:35 PM
User Avatar
Please let me know where is instruction
5:37 PM
User Avatar
In the readme
5:38 PM
For the project
yarn install

For supabase
1. Create new supabase instance
2. Go to SQL editor and paste the script.sql
3. Setup auth (github only)
4. Add the keys as required in the env
5:39 PM
User Avatar
I see.
5:40 PM
Can I use your supabase account?
5:41 PM
User Avatar
Sure, I can setup the supabase instance. But how would you fix the issues as described when you need access to supabase console?
5:42 PM
User Avatar
So do you have to setup supabase now?
5:44 PM
User Avatar
I can set it up, but I think it makes more sense if you setup you own instance, or not?
5:45 PM
User Avatar
Okay
5:48 PM
User Avatar
The sql script is included
5:49 PM
User Avatar
I thought you already have this. slightly smiling face emoji
5:49 PM
Jafe N.
@Jafeno
The sql script is included
I see
5:49 PM
User Avatar
I do, but you will need access to the supabase instance to fix the issues
5:50 PM
That's why the sql script is included
5:50 PM
User Avatar
I see
5:55 PM
User Avatar
How's it going so far?
5:58 PM
User Avatar
I am installing loca env now.
6:04 PM

Sorry bothering for you.
I'm really sorry for multicasting like this because I couldn't find a solution even after gooling.
this time, I am developing the project using laravel9 +  vue 3 + inertiajs +vite.
Everything goes well.
But, If I apply style in vue component and vue page, it doesn't working in production env.

it does working in development env as npm run dev.
So, I think it doesn't build, but the result muddle my idea.
It compiled succefully and exist in public/build folder.

But, laravel app seems to not import the css or scss style of vue component.
If the somebody who have the experience about this prpblem, who can solve this issue, 
I would you like to help me.
Thank your advance.

You know it’s not the same as it was

You know it’s the not the same as it was…. 

This song by Harry Styles came on last night as I was sat in a restaurant unwinding. 

It reminded me how much I kept hearing this song 🎶 earlier this year. 

Before I set off on my travel journey this song played an important role in my life.

It reminded me that after a difficult time my life was no longer the same. 

It reminds me now that my life is not the same as it was. 

If you think about it the pandemic was a sign to us all that our lives were going to change. 

None of us are the same as we were two years ago. 

Bizarrely I didn’t hear the song once last night. 

I heard it again when I got home, right before I went to bed. 

Believe what you want however for me it’s a reassuring sign that I’m on the right path. 

Just like the 11:11 I’ve been seeing on and off for months now. 

Just like the feathers I see pretty much daily after my feather tattoo. 

What signs do you have that your on the right path in life? 

If you don’t have signs yet then start taking some action. 

You’ll probably find that the signs start then coming.

School accounts managed by partners will have a default number of teacher accounts. It would be nice if the partner could expand the number of teachers that the school has. But before this expansion, it must have available Educator accounts that have been previously purchased and activated by the Owner. 

Example: One of our partner buys an "educational center" license. We as owner activate to our partner an "educator center" account that by default has 15 "teacher accounts" available. Our partner registers a new "school" and activates the "educational center" account. The school can now register the teacher accounts, it has 15 available. 
But it happens that the school wants to add more teachers... so it lets the partner know. The partner asks the Owner for more teacher accounts. The owner activates simple educator accounts to the partner, activates 5 more accounts. The partner activates new teacher accounts for the school so that it can register more teachers. The school can now register 5 more teachers.

-------------------------------------
When we sell an "Education Center" account we deliver 15 educator accounts. 
You can see it on our website (although it is in Spanish, you can translate it). 
Schools usually buy an "Education Center" account and activate 15 teachers. But then it can happen that they need more teachers.

Hi Milenko,

A few additional remarks from my side:

- we need to deprecate the gem 'wice_grid' so we need a replacement unless we want to build each page by hand with divs etc. Do you know of a good React standard component that can display tables with a search function?

- when you deliver a new page for testing, I would prefer you
(1) add a route /react/xxxx. For instance, send_email_configuration is in routes.rb under

scope module: :gui do

(3) copy the controller to controllers/gui/xxx in the correct namespace
(2) add a new view in views/gui/xxxx

All new controllers and views need to end up in /gui ;).

Perhaps you could move the 'subscriptions' one into the right folders/namespace. Thanks!

- we will send you a queue of things you can work on. For now, I am trying to pick pages that go (1) from easy to difficult and (2) from low impact if they break to high impact. But point taken.

Cheers,

Michael

- I think you need to place Delete button and Label in the middle of line . Currently its delete button and label is hiding behind the line. 

-Secondly, Decrease the size of square and no need to add colors in it . Just replace squares with circle and grey color inside it !

-When i drag the line outside the image, it is coming out outside which shouldn't

-Last but not least, Bounding box manipulated by just corners , why not lines ?(line drag and drop)
Also add as it's in previous functionality

-Also see in this image, Delete button is behind the line, As instant as i manipulate lines it should straight go with it faster, like no latency(z-index)

-there is a need to decrease the font
-Replace done button with remove

-when i do remove all, Labels and del shouldn't be properly visible
